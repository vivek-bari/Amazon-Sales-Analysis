   - Handled missing values  
   - Removed unnecessary columns  
   - Extracted date features (Month, Quarter, Year)  
   - Created new feature: `order_revenue = qty × amount`

   - Monthly and quarterly sales trends  
   - Top categories and SKUs by revenue  
   - Regional sales distribution (state & city)  
   - Order status and fulfillment comparison  

3. **Power BI Dashboard (3 Pages):**
   - **Sales Overview** → KPIs, revenue trends, top products  
   - **Regional Insights** → Revenue by state & city with filters
